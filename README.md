- 👋 Hi, I am Florinda, a former  UX Designer, currently pursuing a Front-end Development degree at  Noroff - School of technology and digital media. 
      I am a quick learner and a self-starter with a passion for design.  
      As a designer (also a user), I am curious about emerging technology and the design potential behind it. 
      So far I’ve worked on projects in which I used programming languages like HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript.
      I'm also familiar with many tools and frameworks. 
      However, cool tech is not my main driver.
      I care about social issues and want to be able to design products that could be used for everyone.
- 👀 I’m interested in design, ux/ui-design and front end development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ux or front-end development projects.
